The PRD segment contains data specifically focused on a referral, and it is inter-enterprise in nature.  The justification for this new segment comes from the fact that we are dealing with referrals that are external to the facilities that received them.  Therefore, using a segment such as the current PV1 would be inadequate for all the return information that may be required by the receiving facility or application.  In addition, the PV1 does not always provide information sufficient to enable the external facility to make a complete identification of the referring entity.

In some instances it is in the patient's better interest to circumvent these guidelines. In other cases, business rules may exist to support normal process flow, but which may be bypassed or ignored under certain special circumstances. This segment is linked to the proposed ERR segment changes in that the first attempt to process a transaction that violates a business rule may result in an error that must be overridden. The ERR provides a mechanism to identify errors that may be overridden, as well as the allowed override codes.\r\n\r\nUse case #1: A patient has received a prescription with a duration of 30 days and receives the full amount at their pharmacy. While at home the patient accidentally spills the container and spoils a significant proportion of the prescription. The patient returns to their pharmacy and explains the situation to the pharmacy technician. The technician consults with their supervising pharmacist. Knowing the patient, thepharmacist decides to override the business rule stating that the dispensed amount for a prescription may not exceed the prescribed amount. In recording the decision, the pharmacy technician specifies that the Override Type is a \"Compassionate Refill\" and that the Override Code, or reason for the override, is \"Spoilage\". The technician also provides Override Comments to provide an explanation of the situation for future reference. While recording the decision, the technician's user ID is automatically stored in an Override Recorded By field. The pharmacist's ID is stored in the Override Responsible Provider field.\r\n\r\nUse case #2:A hospital wishes to submit an invoice to an insurer who is providing secondary coverage. The invoice is being submitted over a week after the service was performed, which is outside the insurer's normal accept time window. The insurer would normally reject the invoice. However, the submitter includes an Override Type of \"late submission\" as well as an Override Code indicating that the invoice is late due to delays with the primary payor. The secondary insurer examines the override reason and accepts the invoice.\r\n\r\nUsage Note: The override segment should be included in messages adjacent to the segment(s) containing the information that would trigger the business rule(s) that needs to be overridden. The segment should be optional (you shouldn't always need to override business rules), and should be allowed to repeat in circumstances where there may be more than one business rule overridden at the same time. Committees may wish to provide suggested values for override types or codes for use with the OVR segment in different messages.",

Each system has the flexibility to incorporate/map the access values into their security system appropriately; the actual implementation for access to protected data is determined by the individual system.

When a placer requests a given set of observations, always include an order segment. For lab tests, the information in the order segment usually applies to a single specimen. However, there is not a one-to-one relationship between specimen and tests ordered. Different test batteries will usually require their own order segments even when they can be performed on a single specimen. In this case, the specimen information must be duplicated in each of the order segments that employ that specimen. For other diagnostic studies, e.g., chest X-ray, a separate order segment will usually be generated for each diagnostic study.\r\n\r\nThough multiple observation batteries can be ordered on a single order segment, the observation filler shall generate a separate order segment for each battery that it processes independently, e.g., electrolyte, CBC, vital signs. When reporting the observations, the filling service shall copy the appropriate order (specimen) information from the original order segment into each of the new order segments so that a separate \"order\" segment is returned to the placer as a \"header\" for each separate battery of observations.\r\n\r\nIn the event that an ordered battery of observations cannot be performed, e.g., because of hemolysis on a blood sample, an order segment will be returned to the placer with OBR-25-result status equal to X (to indicate that the study was not performed). In this case, no observation segments will be transmitted.\r\n\r\nWhen observations are successfully completed, the message returned to the placer will include the order segment (OBR) followed by observation (OBX) segments for each distinct observation generated by the order (see Chapter 7). The number of such observation segments will depend upon the number of individual measurements performed in the process.\r\n\r\nOBX segments can be sent by the placer along with an order to provide the filling service with clinical data needed to interpret the results. (See Chapter 7 for OBX details.)\r\n\r\nThe daggered (+) items in this segment are created by the filler, not the placer. They are valued by the filler as needed when the OBR segment is returned as part of a report.\r\n\r\nThe starred (*) fields are only relevant when an observation is associated with a specimen.

In the case of an observation obtained directly from a subject (e.g., BP, Chest X-ray), they represent the start and end time of the observation.\r\n\r\nIn the reporting of clinical data, the OBR serves as the report header. It identifies the observation set represented by the following atomic observations. It includes the relevant ordering information when that applies. It contains many of the attributes that usually apply to all of the included observations.\r\n\r\nWhen a set of observations is ordered, the order message contains an OBR segment. However, observations can be collected and reported without an antecedent order. When observations are reported, the report message also includes one or more OBR segments. So, the OBR segment is like a turn-around document. Some fields in the OBR segment apply only to the ordering message and some to the reporting message. To those familiar with healthcare procedures, these should be obvious from their names (e.g., transcriptionist or principal result interpreter could only apply to the reporting phase). However, we have also flagged them in the OBR HL7 Attribute Table to indicate whether placer, filler, or both may send data in a given field.",

To accomplish this, an acknowledgement message with 2 ERR segments is sent. Upon receipt, the sending application can display both, including the appropriate severity, to the user.\r\n\r\nApplication Error Code: A receiving application generates an error that reports an application error code and returns this information in its response. This code in turn is used by helpdesk staff to pinpoint the exact cause of the error, or by the application to prompt an appropriate response from the user. (Ex. Deceased date must be greater than or equal to birth date).\r\n\r\nApplication Error Parameter: A receiving application encounters an error during processing of a transaction. In addition to an error code, the application provides an error parameter that gives greater detail as to the exact nature of the error. The receiving application looks up the message corresponding to the error code, substitutes in the parameter, and displays the resulting message to the user.\r\n\r\nDiagnostic Information: While processing a transaction, a receiving application encounters an exception. When the exception is thrown, it provides a volume of detailed information relating to the error encountered. The receiving application captures the information and sends it in its response. The user reports the error to the help desk, and on request, faxes a copy of the diagnostic information to assist analyzing the problem.\r\n\r\nUser Message: A user executes an application function that generates a transaction that is sent to another application for further processing. During this processing, the receiving application encounters an error and, as part of the error handling routine, retrieves a User Message that it returns in its response. The originating application receives the error and displays it to the end user with the intent that the error condition can be resolved and the user can re-execute the function without error.\r\n\r\nInform Person Code: After submitting a dispense transaction, a response is returned to the user indicating that the patient may be abusing drugs. Given the sensitivity of this warning, the error is returned with an indicator stating that the patient should not be informed of the error with the implication that steps should be taken to rule out or confirm the warning.\r\n\r\nOverride Type: If a business rule states that a prescription on hold cannot be dispensed, an override type might be \"Dispense Held Prescription\" to allow the prescription to be dispensed in exception to the rule.\r\n\r\nOverride Reason Codes: A patient is given a prescription; however, before completing the prescription, the remaining pills are spoiled. The patient returns to their pharmacy and explains the situation to their pharmacist. The pharmacist decides to replace the spoiled drugs; however, when attempting to record the event, a message is returned indicating that the dispense would exceed the maximum amount prescribed. The pharmacist overrides the rule and specifies an Override Reason Code indicating a replacement of lost product.\r\n\r\nHelp Desk Contact: Help desk contact information is stored in a database. When an application error is encountered, the database is queried and the most current help desk contact information is returned in the error message. This is displayed to the user by the receiving application.\r\n\r\nBetter Error Location Information: Receiving system detects an error with the 3rd repetition of the ROL.4 (Role Person - XCN).16 (Name Context – CE).4(Alternate Identifier – CWE). The application identifies the specific repetition and component when raising the error, simplifying diagnosis of the problem.\r\n\r\nSupport for multiple Error Locations: Two fields are marked as conditional, with the condition that one of the two must be specified. The sending application leaves both blank. The receiving application detects the problem, and sends back a single error indicating that one of the fields must be filled in. The ERR segment identifies both positions within the message that relate to the error.",

A given institution, or group of intercommunicating institutions, should establish a list of assigning authorities that may be potential assignors of patient identification (and other important identification) numbers.  The list will be one of the institution's master dictionary lists.  Since third parties (other than the assignors of patient identification numbers) may send or receive HL7 messages containing patient identification numbers, the assigning authority in the patient identification numbers may not be the same as the sending and receiving systems identified in the MSH.  The assigning authority must be unique across applications at a given site.  This field is required in HL7 implementations that have more than a single Patient Administration application assigning such numbers. The assigning authority and identifier type codes are strongly recommended for all CX data types.\r\n\r\nWith HL7 V2.3, the nomenclature for the fourth component of the patient identifiers was changed from \"assigning facility ID\" to \"assigning authority\".  While the identifier may be unique to a given healthcare facility (for example, a medical record assigned by facility A in Hospital XYZ), the identifier might also be assigned at a system level (for example a corporate person index or enterprise number spanning multiple facilities) or by a government entity, for example a nationally assigned unique individual identifier.  While a facility is usually an assigning authority, not all assigning authorities are facilities.  Therefore, the fourth component is referred to as an assigning authority, but retains backward compatibility using the construct of the HD data type (see the note in chapter 2).  Additionally, CX data types support the use of assigning facility (HD) as the sixth component.",

Most often this is used to represent an \"ordering session\" for a single patient.\r\nAn order group is a list of orders (ORCs) associated with an ORC-4-placer group number. A group is established when the placer supplies a placer group number with the original order. The order group consists of all the ORCs and order detail segments that have the same placer group number. Orders can be removed from the group using cancel, or added using the replacement or parent-child mechanisms. New orders cannot otherwise be added to the group.\r\n\r\nb) duplicate fields\r\nThe ORC is intended to uniformly define the fields that are common to all orders (i.e., requested services). Some ORC fields are duplicated in some order detail segments (e.g., OBR, RXO). For example, ORC-2-placer order number has the same meaning and purpose as OBR-2-placer order number field. This promotes upward compatibility with past versions and ASTM.\r\nThe rule for using these fields is that the value must appear in the order detail segment if it does not appear in the ORC. However, it is recommended to transmit the field value in both places to avoid confusion.\r\n\r\nc) parent/child – cancel, hold, discontinue\r\nDuring transmission of a request to cancel, hold, or discontinue a parent order, the request is intended to apply recursively to the parent order and all associated child orders.\r\nFor example:\r\n   1) An EKG application receives an order for three EKGs on successive mornings.\r\n   2) The EKG application creates three child orders, one for each requested EKG.\r\n   3) The first daily EKG has already been performed when a request is received to cancel the original parent order.

A user authentication credential is an encapsulated data (ED type) element, as defined by standards, with no HL7-relevant structure.\r\n\r\nNote: The UAC segment is defined for use within simple protocols, such as MLLP, that do not have user authentication semantics. Implementations that use WSDL/SOAP, or similar protocols, to envelope HL7 should employ the user authentication semantics and data structures available within the scope of those protocols rather than the UAC segment.\r\n\r\nIf the receiving system accepts the user credentials in the UAC segment, no specific acknowledgement is required. However, if the receiving system detects an error while processing the UAC segment, its acknowledgment message shall report it to the sender via an MSA and ERR segment pair:\r\n- The ERR-3 (error code) field value is 207 to signify an application error\r\n- The ERR-7 (diagnostic information) field reports the specific error. Examples of possible errors are:\r\n   - User credentials expected but not provided\r\n   - User credentials invalid\r\n   - User credentials expired\r\n   - User credentials from an unknown or untrusted source\r\n   - User unknown\r\n   - User not allowed to create or access data on the receiving system.\r\n   - User not allowed to initiate a processing function on the receiving system.\r\n\r\nWhen an MSA and ERR segment pair is reported to the sender, an application data response shall not occur. In such cases it is correct to assume that the sending application's user is not authorized to get the data.\r\n\r\nThe processing rules for the ERR segment are outside of HL7's scope.",

If there is an upgrade from version 10 to 10.1, this would be reflected in the SFT segment, but changes to the message contents should be reflected via a new/different conformance profile.\r\n\r\nUse Case: An external application has been customized to communicate with a centralized patient drug history system. However, due to certain, known characteristics of the external software package, the centralized system must modify its behavior in order to process transactions correctly. In one example, the external application may have multiple versions in production.

The TQ2 segment will link the current service request with one or more other service requests.\r\n\r\nThere are many situations, such as the creation of a service request for a group of intravenous (IV) solutions, where the sequence of the individual intravenous solutions (each a service in itself) needs to be specified, e.g., hyperalimentation with multi-vitamins in every third bottle.\r\n\r\nThere are other situations where part of the service request's instructions contains a results condition of some type, such as \"PRN pain.\" There is currently a free text \"condition\" field of TQ1-10 - Condition text which allows any condition to be specified. However, to support a fully encoded version of service request sequencing, or results condition, the TQ2, Timing/Quantity Relationship segment has been defined.\r\n\r\nTQ2 Usage notes:\r\na) Cyclic placer service request groups\r\n   To implement a cyclic group of four IV service requests using the parent/child paradigm, the parent specifies a custom group of IVs, and the following occurs:\r\n   - TQ2 of the second child service request specifies that it follow the first child service request.\r\n   - TQ2 of the third child service request specifies that it follow the second child service request.\r\n   - TQ2 of the fourth child service request specifies that it follow the third service request.\r\n   To repeat the group of four child service requests in a cyclic manner, the following occurs:\r\n   - TQ2 of the first child service request specifies that it is to be executed once without any dependence on the completion of other service requests. Its second execution follows the completion of the fourth service request. See example in Section 4A.5.2 RXO segment field examples.\r\nThis scheme allows the following to be tracked:\r\n   - The status of the whole group of service requests to be reported back at the level of the parent service request.\r\n   - The status for each individual IV service request by following the status of the corresponding child service request.\r\nSeparate Service requests example:\r\n   - The same group of service requests can be sent as a group of four service requests (without a common parent), linked only by the data in their quantity/timing fields. In this case, there is no convenient HL7 method of transmitting the service request status of the group as a whole without transmitting the status of each of the four separate service requests.\r\n\r\nb) Inheritance of service request status\r\n   Cancellation/discontinuation/hold service request control events:\r\n   - This logic implies the normal execution of the referenced predecessor service request. Thus a cancel (or discontinuation or hold) of a predecessor service request implies the cancellation (or discontinuation or hold) of all subsequent service requests in the chain.\r\n   - If the referenced service request has been canceled (or discontinued or held), the current service request inherits that same status.\r\n   - In the case of hold, the removal of the hold of the predecessor implies a removal of the hold for the given service request (which can then be executed according to the specification in the TQ2 segment).",

But the OBX can also be part of an observation order (see Chapter 4, section 4.4, \"General Trigger Events & Message Definitions\"). In this case, the OBX carries clinical information needed by the filler to interpret the observation the filler makes. For example, an OBX is needed to report the inspired oxygen on an order for a blood oxygen to a blood gas lab, or to report the menstrual phase information which should be included on an order for a pap smear to a cytology lab. Appendix 7A includes codes for identifying many of pieces of information needed by observation producing services to properly interpret a test result. OBX is also found in other HL7 messages that need to include patient clinical information.\r\n\r\nWhen using the OBX for the TIM category, OBX-2 Value Type should be valued to DTM. Consequently, OBX-5 Observation Value should have a length of 26 given the format of the DTM data type. Note the expectations on which fields are required as well as the fields that should not be valued.\r\n\r\nWhen using the OBX for the CHN category, OBX-2 Value Type should be valued to CD. Consequently, OBX-5 Observation Value could have a length of up to 65536 given the format of the CD data type. Note the expectations on which fields are required as well as the fields that should not be valued.\r\n\r\nWhen using the OBX for the WAV category, OBX-2 can be valued as either NA or MA. The length of OBX-5 Observation Value depends on the data type chosen. NA is a repeating data type, and the length will depend on the number of repeats. Note the expectations on which fields are required as well as the fields that should not be valued.\r\n\r\nWhen using the OBX for the ANO category, OBX-2 Value Type should be valued to CWE. Consequently, OBX-5 Observation Value could have a length of up the 65536 given the format of the data types. Note the expectations on which fields are required as well as the fields that should not be valued.",

The first component is a string that identifies an individual order (i.e., ORC segment and associated order detail segment). A limit of fifteen (15) characters is suggested but not required. It is assigned by the placer (ordering application). An implementation is HL7 compliant when the number of characters for this field is increased to accommodate applications that require a greater number of characters for the Placer order number. It identifies an order uniquely among all orders from a particular ordering application. The second through fourth components contain the application ID of the placing application in the same form as the HD data type (section 2.A.36, \"HD – Hierarchic designator\"). The second component, namespace ID, is a user-defined coded value that will be uniquely associated with an application. A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required. A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a unique list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers and assign unique application IDs. The components are separated by component delimiters.\r\n\r\nSee ORC-2-placer order number (section 4.5.1.2) for information on when this field must be valued.\r\n\r\nA given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers of orders and assign each a unique application ID. The application ID list becomes one of the institution's master dictionary lists that is documented in Chapter 8. Since third-party applications (those other than the placer and filler of an order) can send and receive ORM and ORR messages, the placer application ID in this field may not be the same as any sending and receiving application on the network (as identified in the MSH segment).\r\n\r\nORC-2-placer order number is the same as OBR-2-placer order number. If the placer order number is not present in the ORC, it must be present in the associated OBR and vice versa. If both fields, ORC-2-placer order number and OBR-2-placer order number, are valued, they must contain the same value. When results are transmitted in an ORU message, an ORC is not required, and the identifying placer order number must be present in the OBR segments.\r\n\r\nThese rules apply to the few other fields that are present in both ORC and OBR for upward compatibility (e.g., quantity/timing, parent numbers, ordering provider, and ordering call back numbers).",

The second component is a user-defined coded value that uniquely defines the application from other applications on the network. A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required. The second component of the filler order number always identifies the actual filler of an order.\r\n\r\nSee ORC-3-filler order number for information on when this field must be valued.\r\n\r\nOBR-3-filler order number is identical to ORC-3-filler order number. If the filler order number is not present in the ORC, it must be present in the associated OBR. (This rule is the same for other identical fields in the ORC and OBR and promotes upward and ASTM compatibility.) This is particularly important when results are transmitted in an ORU message. In this case, the ORC is not required and the identifying filler order number must be present in the OBR segments.\r\n\r\nThe filler order number (OBR-3 or ORC-3) also uniquely identifies an order and its associated observations. For example, suppose that an institution collects observations from several ancillary applications into a common database and this common database is queried by yet another application for observations. In this case, the filler order number and placer order number transmitted by the common database application would be that of the original filler and placer, respectively, rather than a new one assigned by the common database application.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if a third-party application, not the filler or placer, of an order were authorized to modify the status of an order (say, cancel it), the third-party application would send the filler an ORM message containing an ORC segment with ORC-1-order control equal to \"CA\" and containing the original placer order number and filler order number, rather than assign either itself.",

But the pharmacist would dispense a specific capsule size and would record the strength in the RXE segment as 250 or 500, depending upon which capsule size was dispensed.\r\n\r\nSome coding systems imply the strength, units, route of administration, and manufacturer of substances within a single instructional code.  NDC codes, for example, usually imply not only the medical substance, but also the strength, the units, and the form, e.g., 0047-0402-30^Ampicillin 250 MG CAPS^NDC.  So all of this information can also be completely specified in RXO-1-requested give code and in the analogous CE fields in other pharmacy/treatment segments.  In this case, it is not necessary to use the strength and strength units fields to specify this information.",

Valid values for this field are specified in HL7 Table 0211 - Alternate Character Sets. MSH-18 Character Set may be left blank, or may contain one or more values delimited by the repetition separator. If the field is left blank, the character set in use is understood to be the 7-bit ASCII set, decimal 0 through decimal 127 (hex 00 through hex 7F). This default value may also be explicitly specified as ASCII.\r\n\r\nMore than one character set may be used in a message. The first occurrence, if supplied, of the MSH-18 must indicate the default encoding of the message. The second and subsequent occurrences of MSH-18-character set are used to specify additional character sets that are used.\r\nThe repetitions of this field to specify different character sets apply only to fields of the FT, ST and TX data types. See also section 2.7.2, \"Escape sequences supporting multiple character sets\".\r\n\r\nAny encoding system, single-byte or multi-byte, may be specified as the default character encoding in MSH-18 Character Set. If the default encoding is other than 7-bit ASCII, sites shall document this usage in the dynamic conformance profile or other implementation agreement. This is particularly effective in promoting interoperability between nations belonging to different HL7 Affiliates, while limiting the amount of testing required to determine the encoding of a message.\r\n\r\nBy using built-in language functions for string and character manipulation, parsers and applications need not be concerned whether a single or double byte character set is in use, provided it is applied to the entire message. Using a built in function to extract the fourth CHARACTER will always yield the field separator character, regardless of coding set. On the other hand, if the parser looks at the fourth BYTE, it is then limited to single byte character sets, since the fourth byte would contain the low order 8 bits of the character S in a double-byte system.\r\n\r\nNote: When describing encoding rules, this standard always speaks in terms of character position, not byte offset. Similarly, comparisons should be done on character values, not their byte equivalents. For this reason, delimiter characters should always have representation in the standard 7-bit ASCII character set, regardless of the actual character set being used, so that a search for the character CR (carriage return) can be performed.\r\n   a) if the field is not valued, the default single-byte character set (ASCII (\"ISO IR6\")) should be assumed. No other character sets are allowed in the message.\r\n   b) if the field repeats, but the first element is NULL (i.e., present but unvalued), the single-byte ASCII (\"ISO IR6\") is assumed as the default character set.\r\n   c) elements in the remainder of the sequence (i.e., elements 2..n) are alternate character sets that may be used.",

Its first component is a string that identifies the Imaging Service Request. A limit of sixteen (16) characters is required to allow compatibility with DICOM. See DICOM Standard Part 3 for further details on DICOM Attribute (0008,0050) that conveys information identical to the component one of this field.\r\n\r\nAn IDIS that performs functions of the workflow management for a department may accept a single Placer Order that gives rise to one or more Filler Orders-Imaging Service Requests. For example, an IDIS may receive an order for an X-ray examination of the patient daily at 8 am for the next three days. For the purposes of fulfilling the Placer Order, it will identify each of the daily exams either as a separate Filler Order or parts of a single Filler Order. Correspondingly, it will assign one or more Filler Order numbers associated with the order. For each of the Filler Order numbers, it will assign a unique Accession Number.\r\n\r\nEach of the Imaging Service Requests may contain one or more Requested Procedures that it will identify with the Requested Procedure ID. The Requested Procedure is the most granular unit of work that may lead to the creation of the procedure report. Each procedure report contributes to the results for the order. In the example mentioned above, each of the daily examinations will require a separate diagnostic report, hence each of them will be treated as a separate Requested Procedure. Depending on the treatment of the order by the IDIS, it will either link all Requested Procedures to a single Filler Order-Imaging Service Request, or link each Requested Procedure to its own Imaging Service Request. Exact type of requested procedure is conveyed by the coded values in OBR-44 Procedure Code and OBR-45 Procedure Code modifier for each procedure. Note that in case of multiple Requested Procedures corresponding to one order, each procedure may have different code.\r\n\r\nTo support communication with the instances of equipment in a department (acquisition modalities), IDIS will also generate the Study Instance UID, a globally unique identifier for each Requested Procedure. This identifier will be used by acquisition modalities to identify all generated images and other DICOM objects related to this Requested Procedure. Note that, unlike the Study Instance UID, the Requested Procedure ID must only be unique within the scope of the encompassing Imaging Service Request identified by an Accession Number.\r\n\r\nEach of the Requested Procedures may be further broken down by the IDIS into the Scheduled Procedure Steps based on the timing and equipment requirements. Each step is identified with the Scheduled Procedure Step ID. A single Procedure Step may only be performed on a single type and instance of the equipment.

By putting a 1 in the Sub-ID of the first of these OBX segments, 2 in the second, and 3 in the third, we can uniquely identify each OBX segment for editing or replacement.\r\n\r\nThe sub-identifier is also used to group related components in reports such as surgical pathology. It is traditional for surgical pathology reports to include all the tissues taken from one surgical procedure in one report. Consider, for example, a single surgical pathology report that describes the examination of gallbladder and appendix tissue. This report would be transmitted roughly as shown here:\r\nOBR|1||1234^LAB|11529-5^Study report^LN|...<cr>\r\nOBX|1|CWE|88304&ANT|1|T57000^GALLBLADDER^SNM|...<cr>\r\nOBX|2|TX|22634-0^Path report.gross observation^LN|1|THIS IS A NORMAL GALLBLADDER|...<cr>\r\nOBX|3|TX|22635-7^Path report.microscopic observation^LN|1|MICROSCOPIC EXAM SHOWS HISTOLOGICALLY\r\nNORMAL GALLBLADDER TISSUE|...<cr>\r\nOBX|4|CWE|34574-4^Path report.final diagnosis^LN|1|M-00100^NML^SNM|...<cr>\r\nOBX|5|CWE|11529-5&ANT^Surgical Path Report^LN|2|T66000^APPENDIX^SNM|...<cr>\r\nOBX|6|TX|22634-0^Path report.gross observation^LN|2|THIS IS A RED, INFLAMED, SWOLLEN, BOGGY APPENDIX|...<cr>\r\nOBX|7|TX|22635-7^Path report.microscopic observation^LN|2|INFILTRATION WITH MANY PMN's - INDICATING INFLAMATORY CHANGE|...<cr>\r\nOBX|8|CWE|34574-4^Path report.final diagnosis^LN|2|M-40000^INFLAMMATION NOS^SNM|...<cr>\r\n\r\nThe example in Figure 7-2 has two segments for each component of the report, one for each of the two tissues. Thus, there are two 88304&ANT segments; there are two \"22634-0^Path report.gross observation^LN\" segments, and there are two \"22635-7^Path report.microscopic observation^LN\" segments. Segments that apply to the gallbladder all have the sub-identifier 1. Segments that apply to the appendix all have sub-identifier 2.\r\n\r\nThe observation sub ID has other grouping uses. It can be used to organize the reporting of some kinds of fluid intakes and outputs. For example, when intake occurs through multiple intravenous lines, a number of separate observations (OBX segments), the intake volume, the type of intake (Blood, D5W, Plasma, etc.), the site of the IV line, etc. may be needed for each intravenous line, each requiring a separate OBX segment. If more than one IV line is running, we can logically link all of the OBX segments that pertain to the first IV line by assigning them an observation sub ID of 1. We can do the same with the second IV line by assigning them a sub ID 2 and so on. The same would apply to the outputs of surgical drains when there are multiple such drains.\r\n\r\nThe use of the sub ID to distinguish repeating OBXs for the same observation ID is really a special case of using the sub ID to group, as can be seen if we picture the OBX segments as part of a table where the rows correspond to a particular species of observation and the cells correspond to the sub ID numbers that would be associated with each corresponding OBX.\r\n\r\nThe use of Sub IDs to group results is equivalent to defining a table, and the use of sub IDs to distinguish repeats is just a special case, represented by one column in this table.\r\n\r\nHowever, this approach introduces ambiguities if we have a set of repeating observations within a group, e.g., if the appendix observations include two impressions as in the 8th and 9th OBXs shown in the following example. This really represents the existence of a row nested within a single cell of the table.\r\nOBX|1|CWE|880304&ANT|1|T57000^GALLBLADDER^SNM|...<cr>\r\nOBX|2|TX|22634-0^Path report.gross observation^LN|1|THIS IS A NORMAL GALL BLADDER|...<cr>\r\nOBX|3|TX|22635-7^Path report.microscopic observation^LN|1|MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION SHOWS HISTOLOGICALLY\r\nNORMAL GALLBLADDER TISSUE|...<cr>\r\nOBX|4|CWE|34574-4^Path report.final diagnosis^LN|1|M-00100^NML^SNM|...<cr>\r\nOBX|5|CWE|880304&ANT|2|T57000^APPENDIX^SNM|...<cr>\r\nOBX|6|TX|22634-0^Path report.gross observation^LN|2|THIS IS A RED, INFLAMED APPENDIX|...<cr>\r\nOBX|7|TX|22635-7^Path report.microscopic observation^LN|2|INFLAMMATION WITH MANY PUS CELLS-ACUTE INFLAMMATION|...<cr>\r\nOBX|8|CWE|34574-4^Path report.final diagnosis^LN|2|M-40000^INFLAMMATION NOS^SNM|...<cr>\r\nOBX|9|CWE|34574-4^Path report.final diagnosis^LN|2|M-30280^FECALITH^SNM|...<cr>\r\n\r\nThe text under OBX-5-observation value provides guidance about dealing with two OBXs with the same observation ID and observation sub IDs. They are sent and replaced as a unit. However, some systems will take this to mean that the set of OBXs is to be combined into one composite observation in the receiving system. We suggest the use of a dot and a string (similar to the Dewey Decimal system) when users wish to distinguish each of the repeats within one type, or results within a cell for editing and correction purposes. Using this system, the previous example would become the following below. If there are cases where such nesting occurs at even deeper levels, this approach could be extended.\r\nOBX|1|CWE|880304&ANT|1|T57000^GALLBLADDER^SNM|...<cr>\r\nOBX|2|TX|22634-0^Path report.gross observation^LN|1|THIS IS A NORMAL GALL BLADDER|...<cr>\r\nOBX|3|TX|22635-7^Path report.microscopic observation^LN|1|MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION SHOWS HISTOLOGICALLY\r\nNORMAL GALLBLADDER TISSUE|...<cr>\r\nOBX|4|CWE|34574-4^Path report.final diagnosis^LN|1|M-00100^NML^SNM|...<cr>\r\nOBX|5|CWE|880304&ANT|2|T57000^APPENDIX^SNM|...<cr>\r\nOBX|6|TX|22634-0^Path report.gross observation^LN|2|THIS IS A RED, INFLAMED APPENDIX|...<cr>\r\nOBX|7|TX|22635-7^Path report.microscopic observation^LN|2|INFLAMMATION WITH MANY PUS CELLS-ACUTE INFLAMMATION|...<cr>\r\nOBX|8|CWE|34574-4^Path report.final diagnosis^LN|2.1|M-40000^INFLAMMATION NOS^SNM|...<cr>\r\nOBX|9|CWE|34574-4^Path report.final diagnosis^LN|2.2|M-30280^FECALITH^SNM|...<cr>\r\n\r\nUse a null or 1 when there is no need for multiples.\r\n\r\nIf the observation includes a number of OBXs with the same value for the observation ID OBX-3, then one must use different values for the sub-ID. This is in fact the case of the repeats depicted above, but without any need to group sets of OBXs. Three such OBXs could be distinguished by using sub-IDs 1, 2 etc. alternatively, sub-IDs 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 could be used. The following example shows and example of an electrocardiograph chest radiograph report with three diagnostic impressions, using 1,2,3 in the sub-ID field to distinguish the three separate results.\r\nOBX|1|CWE|8601-7^EKG IMPRESSION ^LN|1|^atrial fibrillation|...<cr>\r\nOBX|2|CWE|8601-7^EKG IMPRESSION ^LN|2|^OLD SEPTAL MYOCARDIAL INFARCT|...<cr>\r\nOBX|3|CWE|8601-7^EKG IMPRESSION ^LN|3|^poor R wave progression|...<cr>",

It is not a required field because some systems will report only the Interpretation Codes (OBX-8), especially in product experience reporting. The length of the observation field is variable, depending upon OBX-3-value type. This field may repeat for multipart, single answer results.\r\n\r\nRepresentation\r\nThis field contains the value of OBX-3-observation identifier of the same segment. Depending upon the observation, the data type may be a number (e.g., a respiratory rate), a coded answer (e.g., a pathology impression recorded as SNOMED), or a date/time (the date/time that a unit of blood is sent to the ward). An observation value is always represented as the data type specified in OBX-2-value type of the same segment. Whether numeric or short text, the answer shall be recorded in ASCII text.\r\n\r\nReporting logically independent observations\r\nThe main sections of dictated reports, such as radiologic studies or history and physicals, are reported as separate OBX segments. In addition, each logically independent observation should be reported in a separate OBX segment, i.e., one OBX segment should not contain the result of more than one logically independent observation. This requirement is included to assure that the contents of OBX-6-units, OBX-8-interpretation codes, and OBX-9-probability can be interpreted unambiguously. The electrolytes and vital signs batteries, for example, would each be reported as four separate OBX segments. Two diagnostic impressions, e.g., congestive heart failure and pneumonia, would also be reported as two separate OBX segments whether reported as part of a discharge summary or chest X-ray report. Similarly, two bacterial organisms isolated in a single bacterial culture would be reported as two separate OBX segments.\r\n\r\nThough two independent diagnostic statements cannot be reported in one OBX segment, multiple categorical responses are allowed (usually as CWE data types separated by repeat delimiters), so long as they are fragments (modifiers) that together construct one diagnostic statement. Right upper lobe (recorded as one code) and pneumonia (recorded as another code), for example, could be both reported in one OBX segment. Such multiple \"values\" would be separated by repeat delimiters.\r\n\r\nMultiple OBX segments with the same observation ID and Sub ID\r\nIn some systems, a single observation may include fragments of more than one data type. The most common example is a numeric result followed by coded comments (CWE). In this case, the logical observation can be sent in more than one OBX segment. For example, one segment of numeric or string data type for the numeric result and another segment of CWE data type for coded comments. If the producer was reporting multiple coded comments they would all be sent in one OBX segment separated by repeat delimiters because they all modified a single logical observation. Multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID and sub ID should always be sent in sequence with the most significant OBX segment (the one that has the normal flag/units and or reference range and status flag) first. The value of OBX-6 through 12 should be null in any following OBX segments with the same OBX-3-observation identifier and OBX-4-observation sub-ID. For the purpose of replacement or deletion, multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID and sub ID are treated as a unit. If any are replaced or deleted, they all are replaced.\r\n\r\nCoded values\r\nWhen an OBX segment contains values of CWE data types, the observations are stored as a combination of codes and/or text. In Section 7.7.3, \"CSS - Clinical Study Data Schedule Segment,\" examples of results that are represented as CWE data types are shown in the first and second OBX segments of OBR 1 and the first and second OBX segments of OBR 2. The observation may be an observation battery ID (for recommended studies), a diagnostic code or finding (for a diagnostic impression), or an anatomic site for a pathology report, or any of the other kinds of coded results.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to always encode the information stored within a coded observation. For example, a chest X-ray impression could be transmitted as pure text even though it has a CWE data type. In this case, the test must be recorded as the second component of the result code, e.g.,\r\nOBX|1|CWE|19005^X-Ray Impression^LN|1|^CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.|...<cr>\r\n\r\nHowever, separate impressions, recommendations, etc., even if recorded as pure text, should be recorded in separate result segments. That is, congestive heart failure and pneumonia should not be sent as:\r\nOBX|1|CWE|19005^X-Ray Impression^LN|1|^CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE AND PNEUMONIA|...<cr>\r\n\r\nbut as:\r\nOBX|1|CWE|19005^X-Ray Impression^LN|1|^CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE|...<cr>\r\nOBX|2|CWE|19005^X-Ray Impression^LN|2|^PNEUMONIA|....<cr>\r\n\r\nEven better would be fully-coded results that include computer understandable codes (component 1) instead of, or in addition to, the text description (component 2). One may include multiple values in a CWE value and these can be mixtures of code and text, but only when they are needed to construct one diagnosis, impression, or concept. When text follows codes as an independent value it would be taken as a modifier or addenda to the codes. E.g.,\r\nOBX|1|CWE|19005-8^X-ray impression^LN~29548-5^DiagnosisImpPatient^LN |1|428.0^CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE^I9C~^MASSIVE HEART|...<cr>\r\n\r\nThe text in component 2 should be an accurate description of the code in component 1. Likewise, if used, the text in component 5 should be an accurate description of the code in component 4.\r\n\r\nCDA documents are to be exchanged in the OBX segment. The value of OBX-2-Value Type should be set to 'ED'. OBX-5-Observation Value contains the MIME package encoded as an encapsulated data type. The components should be valued as follows:\r\n- Set the value of OBX-5.2-Type of Data to 'multipart.'\r\n- Set the value of OBX-5.3-Data Subtype to '-hl7-cda-level-one.'\r\n- Set the value of OBX-5.4-Encoding to 'A'. (Note that a MIME package is not itself Base64-encoded. Rather entities within the MIME package are Base64-encoded. A MIME package is sent as ASCII text. Therefore, the correct value is 'A' not 'Base64.'\r\n- Set the value of OBX-5.5-Data to equal the MIME package. Every entity within the MIME package must be Base64-encoded. As stated in Chapter 2, \"the data component must be scanned before transmission for HL7 delimiter characters (and other non-printing ASCII or non-ASCII characters such as LineFeed), and any found must be escaped by using the HL7 escape sequences defined in Section 2.7 'Use of escape sequences in text fields.' On the receiving application, the data field must be de-escaped after being parsed.\" As a result, CR/LF sequences required in the MIME package need to be escaped (i.e., converted to '\\X0D0A\\') prior to transmission. The content type of the first MIME entity is set to 'application/x-hl7-cda-level-one+xml', and should contain the CDA document itself. Multimedia objects referenced by the CDA document that need to be transmitted within the CDA document are to be placed in successive entities of the MIME package.",

This field reflects the current completion status of the results for one Observation Identifier.\r\n\r\nIt is a required field. Previous versions of HL7 stated this implicitly by defining a default value of \"F.\" Code F indicates that the result has been verified to be correct and final. Code W indicates that the result has been verified to be wrong (incorrect); a replacement (corrected) result may be transmitted later. Code C indicates that data contained in the OBX-5-observation value field are to replace previously transmitted (verified and) final result data with the same observation ID (including suffix, if applicable) and observation sub-ID usually because the previous results were wrong. Code D indicates that data previously transmitted in a result segment with the same observation ID (including suffix) and observation sub-ID should be deleted. When changing or deleting a result, multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID and observation sub-ID are replaced or deleted as a unit. Normal progression of results through intermediate (e.g., ‘gram positive cocci’) to final (e.g., ‘staphylococcus aureus’) should not be transmitted as C (correction); they should be transmitted as P (depending upon the specific case) until they are final.\r\n\r\nIf an observation involves multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID (including suffix) and observation sub-ID, the observation result status applies to all OBX segments, except where the value is D or X. The value of D or X is applicable only to the individual OBX. All other OBX segments with the same Observation ID and observation sub-ID must have the same value.\r\n\r\nIn the case of coding systems such as LOINC, the preceding rules typically mean that this field applies to a single OBX segment.\r\n\r\nThere are situations where the observation battery required for the order needs to be dynamically specified at the time of ordering. That is, this battery is then defined by the set of OBX segments transmitted along with the order and generated by the placing system. For example, timed measurements of serum glucose challenge tests may vary among laboratories. One institution may report them at –30, -15, 0, 30, 60, and 120 minutes, while another may report them at –30, 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. Master file entries may exist for each individual element of the battery but not for the battery itself. Another example may be Renin Studies where the specification may be done upon ordering without having a master file definition for each permutation of the possible element. The OBX segments in the ORM message can be used to create dynamic specifications to accommodate these permutations without defining pre-existing master file definitions for the battery itself. The result status field in the OBX can be used to indicate whether the OBX in the ORM message is used to provide a dynamic specification or is used to communicate a result as context to the order. The status of O shall be used to indicate that the OBX segment is used for a dynamic specification of the required result. An OBX used for a dynamic specification must contain the detaile",

An example is an antimicrobial susceptibility result. Some systems prefer to display only the susceptibility results of inexpensive antimicrobials depending upon the organism, the source of the specimen and the patient’s allergy status. The sending service wants to send all of the susceptibilities so that certain privileged users (e.g., Infectious Disease specialists) can review all of the results but non-privileged users would see only the \"preferred\" antimicrobials to which the organism was susceptible.

This value may be determined from a calibration procedure in which an identical time-varying signal is applied to all channels and interchannel time differences are estimated, or more commonly it may be taken from the manufacturer’s specifications for the digitizing system used. For example, for a system which samples successive channels at regular time intervals t, the time skew of channel number n would be (n 1)t. The actual time of sampling (digitization) of sample number m of channel number n in such a system would be R + (m-1)/f + (n-1)t, where R is the reference time at the start of the epoch and f is the channel sampling frequency (t < 1/f)."

This data type provides a way to define repeat pattern codes \"on the fly\". The repeat pattern code is equivalent to the TQ data type, component 2, sub-component 1 (repeat pattern). The additional components define the meaning of the repeat pattern code. Components 2 - 10 are used to define relatively simple repeat patterns. Component 11 is provided to define complex repeat patterns. This data type forms a bridge between the 2.x Repeat Pattern concept from Quantity/Timing, and the Version 3.0 GTS General Timing Specification. Component 1 is the 2.x concept of repeat pattern. Components 2-7 are derived from the version 3.0 data type PIVL. Components 8-10 are derived from the version 3.0 EIVL data type. If a repeat pattern cannot be defined using components 2-10, then component 11, General Timing Specification is provided. This allows the full literal form of the version 3.0 GTS to be specified.\r\n\r\nWhen using the RPT, if an application doesn't recognize the code in component 1, then it may attempt to determine the appropriate frequency using the remaining components. If the application does recognize the code in component 1, the application is not required to determine the frequency from the remaining components.\r\nUse Case: The use case supporting this proposal is the need to define repeat patterns on the fly while placing an order. The TQ data type did not have the capability to define the meaning of a repeat pattern on the fly. To get around this problem, vendors have implemented a variety of solutions to solve this issue. One way was to add Z-components to the TQ data type to transmit information about the repeat pattern. Another solution was to attempt to parse the repeat pattern code in an attempt to decipher what the code meant.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n|Q1H&Every 1 Hour&HL7xxx^^^^1^h|\r\n|Q2J2&Every second Tuesday&HL7xxx^DW^2^^2^wk|\r\n|BID&Twice a day at institution specified times&HL7xxx^^^^12^h^Y|\r\n|QAM&Every morning at the institution specified time&HL7xxx^HD^00^11^1^d^Y|\r\n|QHS&Every day before the hours of sleep&HL7xxx^^^^1^d^^AHS|\r\n|ACM&Before Breakfast&HL7xxx^^^^^^^ACM|",

It adds two additional components, the <universal ID> and the <universal ID type> to the former application ID (which is renamed more generically to be the namespace ID).\r\n\r\nIn the case where an HD identifies an entity that assigns/creates instance identifiers such as a particular patient registration system, it defines an \"assigning authority\". In the case where an HD identifies a location where instance identifiers are given out (although they may be created by another entity at another location) such as a particular \"department of motor vehicles office location,\" it defines an \"assigning facility\". These two different uses of the HD appear in many of the extended data types.\r\n\r\nThe \"assigning authority\" defined by the HD is similar in its role to the coding system (and version) part of the coded element data types: both identify a set of more discrete instance identifiers. The difference is that the set of HD-defined discrete instances contain identifiers of \"real-world\" things such as patient or clinical orders, while the coded element-defined set of discrete instances contains concept identifiers (codes).\r\n\r\nThe HD is designed to be used either as a local identifier (with only the <namespace ID> valued) or a publicly-assigned identifier, a UID (<universal ID> and <universal ID type> both valued). Syntactically, the HD is a group of two identifiers: a local identifier defined by the first component and a universal identifier defined by the second and third components. HDs that have defined third components (defined UID types) must have a second component that is unique within the series of IDs defined by that component.\r\n\r\nNote: \tThe HD is used in fields that in earlier versions of HL7 used the IS data type. Thus, a single component HD (only the first component valued) will look like a simple IS data type for older systems expecting a single component in the place of the HD data type.\r\n\r\nIf the first component for the HD data type is present, the second and third components are optional. If the third component is present, then the second must also be present (although in this case the first is optional). The second and third components must either both be valued (both non-null), or both be not valued (both null). \r\nThis means that if all three components of the HD are valued, the entity identified by the first component is the same as the entity identified by components two and three taken together. However, implementers may choose, by site agreement, to specify that if all three components of the HD are valued, the first component defines a member in the set defined by the second and third components.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\nExample 1: ISO example with only the 2nd and 3rd components valued:\r\n|^2.16.840.1.113883.19^ISO|\r\n\r\nThe syntax of the second component is defined by the ISO standard for object identifiers, not by HL7 (for which the second component is of the ST data type). \r\n\r\nThus the periods (\".\") in the second component are part of the ISO syntax, and are legal by the definition of the HL7 ST data type. \r\n\r\nExample 2: A UUID example\r\n|^478A0114-EBF0-7701-A023-6841FF05731A^UUID|\r\n\r\nExample 3: A DNS example\r\n|^falcon.iupui.edu^DNS|",

For example, the following two values with different representations, “01.20” and “1.2,\" are identical. Except for the optional leading sign (+ or -) and the optional decimal point (.), no non-numeric ASCII characters are allowed. Thus, the value <12 should be encoded as a structured numeric (SN) (preferred) or as a string (ST) (allowed, but not preferred) data type.\r\n\r\nThe NM data type does not follow the normal truncation pattern, and the truncation character is never valid in the NM data type. Instead, the truncation behavior is based on the semantics of numbers. \r\n\r\nValues of type NM may always have leading zeros truncated. Note that HL7 recommends that leading zeros not be used. Unless NM is used to represent a monetary amount, implementations may truncate trailing zeros after the decimal point up to the first non-zero digit or the decimal point, which ever comes first. Any digits to the left of the decimal point may never be truncated (other than leading zeros).\r\n\r\nExample: 1.0200 may be truncated to 1.02, but not to 1.0.",

This important information, together with the information in OBR-29 - Parent, uniquely identifies the parent result’s OBX segment related to this order. The value of this OBX segment in the parent result is the organism or chemical species about which this battery reports. For example, if the current battery is an antimicrobial susceptibility, the parent results identified OBX contains a result that identifies the organism on which the susceptibility was run. This indirect linkage is preferred because the name of the organism in the parent result may undergo several preliminary values prior to finalization.\r\n\r\nWe emphasize that this field does not take the entire result field from the parent.
